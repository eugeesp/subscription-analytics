Subscription Analytics Project



\## 1. Executive Summary



This analysis evaluates the financial and operational performance of a subscription-based digital business over an 18-month period (Jan 2023 – Jun 2024).



The objective is to understand revenue dynamics, churn behavior, cost structure, and overall profitability in order to support data-driven business decisions.

\## 2. Key Insights



\### Insight 1 — Early-stage losses driven by acquisition strategy

During Q1 2023, the business operated at a negative margin, primarily driven by elevated marketing spend aimed at customer acquisition.



Despite negative margins in the first two months, the company reached break-even by March 2023 as recurring revenue accumulated.



\*\*Implication:\*\* Early losses were strategic rather than structural.



---



\### Insight 2 — Strong MRR growth enables operating leverage

Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) shows a consistent upward trend, accelerating faster than fixed costs.



As a result, margins improve steadily over time, demonstrating clear operating leverage typical of scalable subscription models.



---



\### Insight 3 — Marketing is the primary margin volatility driver

Marketing costs show strong seasonality (Q1 and Q4) and represent the largest source of short-term margin volatility.



Infrastructure and support costs remain relatively stable throughout the period.



---



\### Insight 4 — Churn is primarily price-driven

Approximately 35% of churned subscriptions cite pricing as the main cancellation reason, making it the most significant driver of customer attrition.



Competitor pressure and feature gaps are secondary but still relevant.



---



\### Insight 5 — Premium plans disproportionately drive revenue

Higher-tier plans contribute a disproportionate share of net revenue relative to their subscription count.



Lower-tier plans generate volume but dilute overall revenue contribution.



---



\### Insight 6 — Payment fees are stable and well-controlled

Payment processing fees remain consistently between 2% and 3% of net revenue, indicating healthy payment infrastructure and low operational risk in this area.



---



\## 3. Business Recommendations



\### Recommendation 1 — Optimize pricing strategy

Given the high share of price-related churn, the business should explore:

\- price-tier restructuring,

\- targeted discounts for at-risk users,

\- value-based pricing experiments.



---



\### Recommendation 2 — Reallocate marketing spend toward higher-LTV plans

Marketing investment should be gradually shifted toward acquisition channels and campaigns that favor higher-tier plan conversions.



This would improve revenue efficiency without increasing total spend.



---



\### Recommendation 3 — Monitor churn cohorts around month 1 and renewal periods

Churn spikes are more likely during early lifecycle stages and around renewal points.



Targeted onboarding improvements and renewal incentives could materially improve retention.



---



\### Recommendation 4 — Maintain current payment infrastructure

Given the stability of payment fees, no immediate changes are recommended in payment providers or methods.



---
